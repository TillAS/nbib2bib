## NBIB to bibTeX Converter

This python code checks the nbib files in the current directory, gets the DOI and, with urllib, generates the bib text from the DOI. Finally, the program creates a ref.bib file and saves it in a directory called bibs. The output file contains the bib text of all nbib files in the directory.

When the code is executed, the terminal will show the message "Press enter to continue". After pressing enter, conversion will begin.

This repository contains some nbib files to test the program. Save nbib in the same folder as nbib2bib.py and run the program.
