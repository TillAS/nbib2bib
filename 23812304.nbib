TI  - Modulation of immune function by polyphenols: possible contribution of epigenetic 
      factors.

AB  - Several biological activities have been described for polyphenolic compounds, 
      including a modulator effect on the immune system. The effects of these biologically 
      active compounds on the immune system are associated to processes as differentiation 
      and activation of immune cells. Among the mechanisms associated to immune regulation 
      are epigenetic modifications as DNA methylation of regulatory sequences, histone 
      modifications and posttranscriptional repression by microRNAs that influences the 
      gene expression of key players involved in the immune response. Considering that 
      polyphenols are able to regulate the immune function and has been also demonstrated 
      an effect on epigenetic mechanisms, it is possible to hypothesize that there exists 
      a mediator role of epigenetic mechanisms in the modulation of the immune response by 
      polyphenols.
